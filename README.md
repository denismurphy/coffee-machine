# ☕ EspressoEngine: Arduino-ESP32 Smart Coffee Machine Controller

EspressoEngine is an innovative project that transforms your ordinary coffee machine into a smart, programmable marvel using Arduino and ESP32! ✨

## 🚀 Features

- 🧼 Automated clean cycle
- ☕ Precise coffee grinding control
- 🎯 Perfect shot pulling
- 🥛 Milk wand activation
- 🚰 Hot water dispensing
- 🌡️ Temperature monitoring
- 📊 Real-time state tracking

## 💻 Code Overview

Our project consists of two main files:

### 📄 `coffee_machine.h`

This header file is the blueprint of our coffee machine's brain, containing:

- 🔢 Pin constants
- 🔀 State enumerations
- 📝 Function prototypes

### 📄 `coffee_machine.c`

This is where the magic happens! Key functions include:

- `coffee_machine_init()`: 🔌 Powers up your coffee machine
- `start_clean_cycle()`: 🧼 Keeps your machine sparkling clean
- `grind_coffee()`: ⚙️ Grinds your beans to perfection
- `pull_shot()`: ☕ Extracts that liquid gold
- `activate_milk_wand()`: 🥛 Froths milk like a pro
- `activate_hot_water_dispenser()`: 🚰 Dispenses hot water on demand
- `check_temperature()`: 🌡️ Ensures optimal brewing temperature
- `get_current_state()`: 📊 Keeps you informed of the machine's status

## ⚠️ Important Note

This code is designed for a hypothetical coffee machine. Your specific hardware may require additional configuration and safety measures. Always prioritize safety when working with electrical equipment! ⚡
